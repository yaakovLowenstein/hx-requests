Hx-requests is a package to simplify the usage of htmx with Django.
It enables an application to make asyncronous requests without clogging up
views and urls with extra code. It simplifies making django forms post asyncronously
with htmx, and many other awesome features.

The idea of hx-requests is that `HXRequests` absorb all htmx requests.
Define an `HXRequest` and
observe the magic of `hx-requests`.

- No need to define extra urls to handle these requests
- No need to add anything extra in views
- Reusable `HXRequests` across views
- Built in `HXRequests` to reduce boilerplate code
