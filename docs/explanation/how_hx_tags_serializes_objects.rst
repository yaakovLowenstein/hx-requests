How Objects Are Serialized
--------------------------

Serialization in :code:`hx_requests` ensures that Django model instances and other data types
can be safely passed through HTMX requests.

Since HTMX requests donâ€™t natively support passing complex Python objects,
:code:`hx_requests` provides a custom serialization method that allows Django models
and additional data to be included in GET and POST requests.

Serializing Model Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a model instance is serialized, it is converted into a structured string format
that includes the prefix :code:`model_instance`, to differentiate from other URL parameters, the app label, model name, and primary key.

For example, a :code:`User` instance with :code:`pk=5` in the :code:`auth` app
would be represented as:

.. code-block:: text

    model_instance__auth__user__5

This ensures that objects can be passed in requests without requiring JSON encoding.

If the value being serialized is not a Django model instance,
it is simply converted to JSON.

Deserializing Model Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a serialized object is received, it needs to be converted back into a Django model instance.
This is done by extracting the app label, model name, and primary key,
then retrieving the object from the database.

If the received value is not a model instance, it is treated as a standard JSON object.

This process ensures that Django objects can be reconstructed properly when handling HTMX requests.

Handling :code:`kwargs` Serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each keyword argument is prefixed with :code:`___` to differentiate it from standard query parameters.
When deserializing, the prefix is removed, and values are restored to their original form.

This allows :code:`hx_requests` to safely pass complex parameters in HTMX requests.
